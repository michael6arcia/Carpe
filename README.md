# Carpe

Carpe is a simple productivity application that allows you to keep your goals in mind as you work.
By assigning yourself tasks, you motivate yourself to complete them. Each completed task is saved in a completed column, making ways for your new or upcoming tasks.
Carpe utilizes handlebars, node.js, and express.js for server-side functionality as well as mySQL for it's database.
